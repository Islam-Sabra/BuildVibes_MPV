# Review 50: the founder's slice 1 test, findings — 17 Oct 2026 (running list)

The founder is testing slice 1 (build af2802b) on his Xiaomi and the emulator. The findings collect here; fixes are decided at the end of the test.

## F1. The + (Create) is expected to make a work item
On his first try, the founder tapped the orange + to write a work item and landed in the Home feed composer. A foreman will do the same. Create is for public posts (H2); a work item is written from inside a Space ("Work item" bar). Fix to be decided after the test.
- **Lead's first thought:** + opens one small choice, "Post to everyone" or "Work item in a Space ▸" (last Space first). That would be one tap more for posts, and no dead end.

## F2. A reply to a reply loses who was answered (Home feed)
- **What the founder saw:** A comments on a post, B replies to A, then C replies to B. C's reply shows as a reply to A.
- **Cause (server, migration 12 `reply_post`):** `reply_to` may only point at a top-level reply (`r.reply_to is null`). So a reply to a reply is stored against the top comment, and the person actually answered is lost.
- **The rule (as LinkedIn and Facebook do it), to confirm with the founder:**
  - keep **two levels** on screen: a comment, and its replies under it;
  - a reply to a reply sits under the same comment but reads **"Replying to {the person answered}"**, and that person gets the notification.
  - No deeper nesting: it doesn't fit a phone.
- **Fix:** a small migration plus the app.
  - `reply_post` accepts a reply to any reply on the same post. It stores the person answered and files the reply under the top comment.
  - The thread shows "Replying to …" with that person's name.
  - The `post_reply` notification goes to the person answered (and the post's author, as now).
  - Tests: three levels of answering; the notification goes to the right person; a deleted reply's answers stay under the same comment.
